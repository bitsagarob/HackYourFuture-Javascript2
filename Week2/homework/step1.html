  <h1>Step 1: More map, filter and =></h1>
  <div>
    <h2>1.1 </h2>
    <p>Say you would like to write a program that doubles the odd numbers in an array and throws <br>
      away the even numbers. Your solution could be something like this:.</p>
    <h3 id='array1'> </h3><br>
    <button id='1'> Test</button><br>
    <h3 id='r1'> Result appears here: </h3> <br>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>1.2 </h2>
    <p id='S1-2'>
      Underneath you see a very interesting small insight in Maartje's work:<br><br>
      <div id='objs'></div>
    </p>
    <p id='S1-2'>
      Note: the durations are specified in minutes.<br><br>
      Write a program that computes how much Maartje has earned by completing these tasks, using map and filter. For
      the 'summing part' you can try your luck with reduce; alternatively, you may use forEach or a for loop.<br>
      Follow these steps. Each step should build on the result of the previous step.<br>
      <ul>
        <li> Map the tasks to durations in hours.</li>
        <li> Filter out everything that took less than two hours (i.e., remove from the collection)</li>
        <li> Multiply the each duration by a per-hour rate for billing (use €20/hour) and sum it all up.</li>
        <li> Output a formatted Euro amount, rounded to Euro cents, e.g: €11.34.</li>
        <li> Choose variable and parameters names that most accurately describe their contents or purpose. When naming
          an<br>
          array, use a plural form, e.g. durations. For a single item, use a singular form, e.g. duration. For details,
          see Naming Conventions.</li>
        <li> Don't forget to use =>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
